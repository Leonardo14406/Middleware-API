# Facebook Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "Error retrieving userID"

✅ **Good News**: Network connectivity is now working!  
❌ **New Issue**: Facebook is blocking login due to security measures

## What This Error Means

Facebook's security systems have flagged your login attempt as suspicious because:
- Login from a new/unknown location or device
- Automated login detected (bot-like behavior)
- Account may have security restrictions
- Two-factor authentication required
- Account temporarily limited

## Step-by-Step Solutions

### 1. Verify Account in Browser (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

```bash
# Open browser and navigate to:
https://www.facebook.com
```

**Do this:**
1. Log in with the same email/password you're using in the app
2. Complete any security challenges (captcha, 2FA, etc.)
3. Verify your identity if prompted
4. Make sure you can access Messenger normally
5. Leave the browser session active

### 2. Account Security Settings

**Check these settings in Facebook:**
- Go to Settings & Privacy → Security and Login
- Review "Where You're Logged In" - authorize your current location
- Check if "Unrecognized Logins" shows your server's location as blocked
- Temporarily disable "Get alerts about unrecognized logins"

### 3. Enable "Less Secure App Access" Equivalent

**For the account you're using:**
1. Go to Facebook → Settings → Security
2. Look for "App Passwords" or "Third-party app access"
3. Generate an app-specific password if available
4. Use this password instead of your regular password

### 4. Use Account That's Already "Bot-Friendly"

**Create or use a dedicated Facebook account that:**
- Has been active for messaging/chatbots before
- Has fewer security restrictions
- Is not your personal primary account
- Has 2FA disabled temporarily for testing

### 5. Bypass Security Temporarily

**Try these approaches:**

```javascript
// Method 1: Add user agent and additional options
const credentials = { 
  email, 
  password,
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
};

// Method 2: Use different login approach
const credentials = {
  email,
  password,
  forceLogin: true,
  logLevel: "silent"
};
```

### 6. Geographic/IP Issues

**If your server is in a different country:**
- Use a VPN to match your account's usual location
- Contact Facebook to whitelist your server's IP
- Use a proxy service in your account's home country

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Manual Browser Verification
```bash
# 1. Open browser, login to Facebook
# 2. Go to messenger.com
# 3. Send a test message
# 4. Keep browser open
```

### Test 2: Try Different Account
```bash
# Use a different Facebook account that:
# - Is newer/has fewer restrictions
# - Has been used for automation before
# - Is not your primary personal account
```

### Test 3: Network Location Match
```bash
# If possible, test from the same network/location where
# the Facebook account is usually accessed
```

## Common Facebook Restrictions

### Temporary Blocks (24-48 hours)
- Too many failed login attempts
- Unusual activity detected
- New location access

### Account Limitations
- New accounts (less than 30 days old)
- Accounts with recent security issues
- Accounts with limited friend connections

### Regional Restrictions
- Some countries have limited Facebook API access
- Corporate networks may be blocked
- VPN/proxy detection

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. Facebook Graph API (Recommended for Production)
```javascript
// Instead of facebook-chat-api, use official Graph API
const accessToken = "your_page_access_token";
const apiUrl = `https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/me/messages`;
```

### 2. Webhook-Based Approach
```javascript
// Set up Facebook webhook to receive messages
// Instead of polling/maintaining persistent connection
app.post('/webhook/facebook', (req, res) => {
  // Handle incoming messages
});
```

### 3. Facebook Business Platform
- Use Facebook Business Manager
- Create a Facebook App
- Use official Messenger Platform APIs
- More reliable for production use

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Test current connectivity
node test-facebook-connectivity.js

# Check if you can access Facebook normally
curl -I https://www.facebook.com

# Check your public IP (to see if location changed)
curl ifconfig.me

# Test with different user agent
curl -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; ChatBot/1.0)" https://www.facebook.com
```

## If All Else Fails

1. **Wait 24-48 hours**: Facebook blocks often auto-expire
2. **Use different account**: Create a new account specifically for bot use
3. **Contact Facebook**: Report the issue through proper channels
4. **Switch to official APIs**: Use Facebook Graph API instead
5. **Use different platform**: Consider WhatsApp Business API or Telegram

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
```
✅ Facebook connectivity test successful
✅ Facebook login successful
✅ UserID retrieved successfully
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Error retrieving userID
❌ Login blocked/restricted
```

## Next Steps After Fixing

Once authentication works:
1. Test sending a message
2. Test receiving messages
3. Set up proper error handling for future blocks
4. Consider implementing session persistence
5. Plan migration to official APIs for production
